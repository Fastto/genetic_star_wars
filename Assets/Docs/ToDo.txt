In Progress:
- ship shows HEALTHBAR: lives, fire cooldown, % of gold in holds




TODO:
- ship rotates around with stable angle speed
- station repair the ship? for gold
- animation of repairing
- explode ship on die


- genome manages ship characteristics visual and as fact values
- ship collects statistics of 
-- total collected gold
-- total damage

- gold showes amount,
- flag - unlimited gold


- station has strategy which genome to use for new ship
- UI toolbox for genome statistics
--- team stats
--- genomes on the screen
--- top 10 genomes as unactive sliders and its results
------ quantity of ships
------ avg damage
------ avg gold
------ avg scores
------ avg lifetime
- genome stat = 20 x 20

- at leas 1 point of damage
- at leas 1 point of armor
- at least 1 point of hold

genome value 
0.05 - 0.95, step 0.05
