DONE:
- Station produces the ship

TODO:
- Ship follows to free gold if is empty
- Ship follows to station if has gold on board
- SHip attacks enemy
- Ship put gold on map if dies
- Ship follows to busy gold by enemy
- Ship follows to enemy if there is no gold
- minipart of gold from killeld ships is visible for alive ships
- station is rotating
- space is rotations
- gold is animated
- gun particles
- ship engine particles
- genome manages ship characteristics visual and as fact values
- ship collects statistics of 
-- total collected gold
-- total damage
- station repair the ship? for gold
- animation of mining
- animation of unloading gold
- animation of repairing
- Idle state - ??? ship flies to station or by random trajectory
- gold showes amount, size of gold depends on amount
- flag - unlimited gold
- ship shows HEALTHBAR: lives, fire cooldown, % of gold in holds
- station shows statistics:
--- produced ships
--- alive ships
--- killed enemies
--- available gold
--- received gold
- station has strategy which genome to use for new ship
- UI toolbox for genome statistics
--- team stats
--- genomes on the screen
--- top 10 genomes as unactive sliders and its results
------ quantity of ships
------ avg damage
------ avg gold
------ avg scores
------ avg lifetime
- genome stat = 20 x 20

- at leas 1 point of damage
- at leas 1 point of armor
- at least 1 point of hold

genome value 
0.05 - 0.95, step 0.05
