In Progress:
- UI toolbox for genome statistics
--- team stats
--- genomes on the screen
--- top 10 genomes as unactive sliders and its results
------ quantity of ships
------ avg damage
------ avg gold
------ avg scores
------ avg lifetime
--- genome view = 3 color slider

TODO:
- graph gold / alive ships
- explode ship on die
- web publish
- restart game
- configure game - configure strategies and press play
- control speed - X2 label
- end game screen --- show stats, graph, winner

- score function - part of strategy
- flag - unlimited gold
- ship rotates around with stable angle speed
- bug with following to gold
- station repair the ship? for gold
- animation of repairing
- 3-rd team 
- cross random strategy
- cross random mutate
